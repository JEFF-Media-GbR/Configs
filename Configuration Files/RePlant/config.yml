#####################

# RePlant can automatically replant harvested crops. Every player can individually
# enable or disable this feature using "/replant crops".

# Delay in seconds before replanting crops. Set to 0 to instantly replant crops.
crop-replant-delay: 1.0

# When set to true, RePlant only replants fully grown crops.
crop-replant-only-fully-grown: false

# When true, RePlant drops seeds as usual. See the next option too when you set this to true
# When false, no saplings at all will be dropped for automatically replanted crops
crop-replant-drops-seeds: true

# When set to true, RePlant reduces the dropped seeds by one so you don't get more
# seeds than in vanilla.
# When set to false, RePlant does not alter the drops, which means that every replanted
# crop basically results in one free seed.
crop-replant-costs: true

# Replanting takes this amount of seeds
crop-replant-cost-amount: 1

# When set to true, new players will have replanting enabled by default
crop-replant-enabled-by-default: false

# When set to true, RePlant only replants crops harvested using a hoe.
# In future versions, an enchant will be available, too!
crop-replant-requires-hoe: false

# When to true, RePlant only replants crops when you harvest them using
# right-click. ONLY WORKS IN 1.17+
crop-replant-requires-rightclick: false

# When you have BOTH, "crop-replant-requires-hoe" AND "crop-replant-requires-rightclick" enabled,
# you can decide whether a player needs to use both, a hoe AND a right-click at the same time,
# or whether it's enough if one of those conditions is satisfied.
# This has no effect if you don't have both mentioned options set to true.
# When set to true, players must right-click with a hoe in their main hand to have crops replanted.
# When set to false, players must either right-click OR have a hoe in their main hand.
crop-replant-requires-both: false

# When your players use click-bots to afk plant and harvest crops using bonemeal, you can prevent
# them from doing so by setting this to true. It will simply not let them harvest crops using right-click
# when they have bonemeal in one of their hands.
dont-replant-when-harvesting-with-bonemeal: false

# You can change the priority here to avoid conflicts with other plugins
# who randomly think it's a good idea to clear the BlockDropItemEvent's
# drop list on HIGH priority, even when the player doesn't have any
# enchantment for this to be necessary. It's just stupid, so adjust
# this if you have any trouble with strange enchantment plugins.
# Available values: LOWEST, LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, HIGHEST, MONITOR

#########################

# Fallen down saplings can be automatically planted when they are on the correct ground type for this tree type.
plant-fallen-saplings: true

# The sapling will be automatically planted after this amount of seconds.
# Default is 120 seconds (2 minutes) so you still have time to pick it up if you like.
# Maximum is 300 seconds (5 minutes) because items despawn after 5 minutes.
# Set to 0 to instantly plant all saplings.
plant-fallen-saplings-delay: 120.0

# When set to false, saplings thrown on the ground by a player will not be planted
plant-fallen-saplings-thrown-by-player: true

# You should leave this enabled in case saplings are being stacked

# When enabled, wearing leather armor prevents trampling crops.
leather-armor-prevents-trampling: false

# Only has an effect when "leather-armor-prevents-trampling" is true.
# When set to true, wearing leather boots always prevents crop trampling.
# When false, every piece of leather armor adds a 25% chance to prevent trampling,
# meaning that players with a full leather armor cannot trample crops anymore.
only-require-boots: true

# When true, crops can only be harvested using a hoe. This is independent of any replanting settings.
