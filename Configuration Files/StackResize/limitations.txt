Please be aware of the following limitations!

1. Stack sizes cannot exceed 64. In theory, it would be possible, but the client simply doesn't allow you to stack more
    than 64 items by clicking them.

2. Tools can currently not be stacked, nor can armor. This will be possible some time in the future, but not now, as
    it requires to handle a ton of vanilla logic.

3. If you use plugins that let you open shulkerboxes without placing them, you WILL encounter item loss if you make
    shulker boxes stackable. So: Only make them stackable if you do not use any of those plugins (e.g. ShulkerPacks)

4. Max stack size can only be adjusted per MATERIAL, not per "individual" item. That means: you can make all regular
    potions stack up to 16, lingering potions stack up to 8 and splash potions stack up to 4, but you cannot
    differentiate between potions of healing, potions of swiftness, etc.
