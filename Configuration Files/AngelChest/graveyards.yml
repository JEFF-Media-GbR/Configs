# ##### PREMIUM FEATURE: ONLY AVAILABLE IN AngelChest Plus!
# 
# You can define certain graveyard areas here. If a player dies in a world where graveyards are enabled,
# the AngelChest will not spawn at the player's death location, but somewhere inside the nearest graveyard.
# 
# You can also use the /acgraveyard (Permission: angelchest.admin) to define and change graveyards.
# 
# IMPORTANT: You must rename this file to "graveyards.yml" to use the Graveyards feature!
# 
# Every graveyard must have specified AT LEAST the location (world, min.x, min.y, min.z, max.x, max.y, max.z)
# 
# 
# Optional values:
# 
# 
#   global: When set to true, players will be sent to this graveyard when there is no graveyard in the player's current world.
#           You should only define one global graveyard.
#           When not set, it defaults to false.
# 
#           Example:
#             global: true
# 
# 
#   grave-locations: When set, the graves will only spawn on top of the given blocks.
#                    When not set, graves can spawn on top of any block.
# 
#                    Example:
#                      grave-locations:
#                      - ROOTED_DIRT
#                      - GRAVEL
# 
# 
#   material: When set, the AngelChests in this graveyard will use this material
#             When not set, AngelChests will use the default material
# 
#             Example:
#               material: CANDLE
# 
# 
#   hologram-text: Set a custom hologram text that only applies to graves in this graveyard.
# 
#                  Example:
#                    hologram-text: "&c&l[Rest in Peace]&r\n&7Here lies\n§6{player}\nKilled by {deathcause}"
# 
# 
#   spawn: You can define a location where players will be spawned after they were buried at this graveyard.
#          When not set, AngelChest will not change the player's spawn location.
#          You can also define another world. If world is not set, it uses the graveyard's world.
#          Yaw is the "left/right" rotation of the player.
#               0 = facing south
#              90 = facing west
#             180 = facing north
#             270 = facing east
#          Pitch is the "up/down" rotation of the player.
#               0 = facing straightforward
#             -90 = facing at the sky
#              90 = facing at the ground.
# 
#           Example:
#             spawn:
#               x: 20.5
#               y: 64
#               z: 30
#               yaw: 90             (optional)
#               pitch: 0            (optional)
#               world: otherworld   (optional)
# 
# 
#   instant-respawn: When true, players will be instantly respawned after being buried in this graveyard.
#                    You will probably only want to use this when you defined a spawn for this graveyard.
#                    Defaults to false.
# 
#                    Example:
#                      instant-respawn: true
# 
# 
#   totem-animation: When true, players will be shown a totem of undying animation when they respawn inside
#                    a graveyard. You will probably only want to use this when you defined a spawn for this
#                    graveyard.
#                    You can set this to true to play a regular totem animation, or use an integer if you
#                    are using CustomModelData for your totems.
#                    Defaults to false.
# 
#                    Example:
#                      totem-animation: true
#                    or:
#                      totem-animation: 3
# 
# 
#   potion-effects: You can define potion effects that will be applied to all players while they are inside
#                   the graveyard. Their previous effects will be restored once they leave the graveyard.
#                   You can also set the effect's multiplicator.
# 
#                   Example:
#                     potion-effects:
#                       BLINDNESS: 0        (= blindness level lvl 1)
#                       MINING_FATIGUE: 9   (= mining fatigue lvl 10)
# 
# 
#   local-time: You can have the graveyard use a specific time. Normal values range from 0 to 24000.
#               You can also use values above 24000 to change the moon phase.
#               This does NOT affect mob spawning etc, it's just a cosmetic effect.
#               When not set, the graveyard uses the world's current time.
#               Normal time: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Daylight_cycle#24-hour_Minecraft_day
#               Moon phases: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Daylight_cycle#Moon_phases
# 
#               Examples:
#                 local-time: 6000     (noon)
#               or:
#                 local-time: 14000    (full moon starting to rise)
#               or:
#                 local-time: 18000    (full moon at its peak)
#               or:
#                 local-time: 110000   (new moon)
# 
# 
#   local-weather: Same as local-time, just for weather.
#                  When not set, the graveyard uses the world's current wheather.
#                  Available values: sun, rain
# 
#                  Example:
#                    local-weather: rain
